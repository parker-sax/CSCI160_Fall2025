    "Most of the time any data that we work with will come from some sort of a data file. There are a few ways that files can be opened and worked with depending on how they are structured. For tabular data, files with data seperated by commas, the easiest way is with pandas. For gridded data, multi-dimensional data organized with metadata and spatial coordinates the easiest thing to use is numpy. Today we will be using the built in ***open()*** function.\n",

    "The data that we are working with today is actual radiosonde data I collected in Ocean City, Maryland in January 2025. This particular radiosonde was in the air for ~90 minutes and got to ~40 mb before it lost connection. It was cold and exteremly windy that day so you better appreciate this data cause it was a pain to get. \n",
